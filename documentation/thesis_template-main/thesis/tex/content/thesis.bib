  abstract = {In metals thermal conductivity is proportional to electrical conductivity and typically of little interest. Here, we have observed giant quantum oscillations in thermal conductivity of the Dirac semimetal ZrTe5, four orders of magnitude larger than expected, even though thermal transport at zero-field is dominated by phonons, which are neutral and thus insensitive to magnetic fields. We identify a generic mechanism for an enhanced absorption of phonons by electrons for metals in quantizing magnetic fields, leading to appearance of quantum oscillations in transport properties of phonons. Our results demonstrate that phonon absorption can be leveraged to reveal other degrees of freedom through their imprint on longitudinal thermal transport of phonons, even if those degrees of freedom have negligible contribution to thermal conductivity. Oscillations of conductance observed in strong magnetic fields are a striking manifestation of the quantum dynamics of charge carriers in solids. The large charge carrier density in typical metals sets the scale of oscillations in both electrical and thermal conductivity, which characterize the Fermi surface. In semimetals, thermal transport at low-charge carrier density is expected to be phonon dominated, yet several experiments observe giant quantum oscillations in thermal transport. This raises the question of whether there is an overarching mechanism leading to sizable oscillations that survives in phonon-dominated semimetals. In this work, we show that such a mechanism exists. It relies on the peculiar phase-space allowed for phonon scattering by electrons when only a few Landau levels are filled. Our measurements on the Dirac semimetal ZrTe5 support this counterintuitive mechanism through observation of pronounced thermal quantum oscillations, since they occur in similar magnitude and phase in directions parallel and transverse to the magnetic field. Our phase-space argument applies to all low-density semimetals, topological or not, including graphene and bismuth. Our work illustrates that phonon absorption can be leveraged to reveal degrees of freedom through their imprint on longitudinal thermal transport.}
